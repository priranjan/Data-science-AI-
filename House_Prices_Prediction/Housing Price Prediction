Housing Price Prediction 
"Buying a house is a stressful thing."

We built a model to predict the prices of residential homes
using advanced ML techniques. This model will provide buyers with a rough estimate of what the houses are actually worth. We first analyzed the data to find trends.

I have used various algorithms to do a comparitive study of the score . The Algorithms used are

RandomForestRegressor
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
SGDRegressor
DecisionTree
I have also done dataset analysis through visualisation . The Silent features used are 1. use of pipeline 2. Use of Cross Validation 3. One hot encoding 4. Usage of Dataframe. 5. mean_squared_error 6. LabelBinarizer 7. Pandas methods

In this project comparitive analysis of the score can be seen .
